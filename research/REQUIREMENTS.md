# Compliance Module Requirements

## Overview
Module responsible for ensuring EU AI Act, NIST, and ISO standard compliance across the entire AMI-ORCHESTRATOR framework. This module provides documentation, validation tools, and automated compliance checking for AI systems.

**Note:** The core backend for many of these requirements is implemented in the `/base` module. This module should act as a specialized layer that integrates with and extends the functionality of the `/base` module.

## Core Requirements

### 1. EU AI Act Compliance
- **Risk Assessment Framework**
  - **[PENDING]** Automated classification of AI systems by risk level.
  - **[PENDING]** Documentation generation for high-risk AI applications.
- **Transparency Requirements**
  - **[PENDING]** Clear disclosure when users interact with AI systems.
- **Data Governance**
  - **[PARTIALLY IMPLEMENTED]** GDPR compliance validation (core reporting in `/base`).

### 2. NIST AI Risk Management Framework
- **Governance Tools**
  - **[PENDING]** Risk management policy templates.
- **Risk Mapping**
  - **[PENDING]** Risk identification and assessment.

### 3. ISO/IEC Standards Compliance
- **ISO/IEC 23894** (AI risk management)
  - **[IMPLEMENTED]** Compliance audit trails (core implementation in `/base`).

## Technical Architecture

### Core Components

The `compliance` module should contain the following components, which will integrate with the `base` module:

```
compliance/
├── validators/           # Compliance validation engines
│   ├── eu_ai_act.py      # EU AI Act specific validators
│   ├── nist.py           # NIST framework validators
│   └── iso.py            # ISO standards validators
├── generators/          # Document and report generators
│   └── reports.py        # Compliance reports
└── monitors/           # Continuous compliance monitoring
    └── scheduled.py      # Scheduled audits
```

### Integration Requirements

- **Base Module Integration**
  - **[CRITICAL]** Integrate with `base/backend/dataops/security/audit_trail.py` for audit logging.
  - **[CRITICAL]** Integrate with `base/backend/dataops/security/compliance_reporting.py` for generating compliance reports.

## Implementation Specifications

### Validation Engine
```python
from base.backend.dataops.security.compliance_reporting import ComplianceReport

class ComplianceValidator:
    """Base compliance validation engine"""
    
    async def validate_eu_ai_act(self, system_config: dict) -> ComplianceReport:
        """Validate against EU AI Act requirements"""
        # This method should use the reporting tools from the /base module
        pass
```

### Risk Assessment Framework
```python
from base.backend.dataops.security.audit_trail import AuditChain

class RiskAssessmentEngine:
    """AI system risk assessment"""
    
    def classify_risk_level(self, ai_system: dict) -> str:
        """Classify AI system risk per EU AI Act"""
        # This method should log its activities to the audit trail in /base
        pass
```

## Data Requirements

### Compliance Database
- **[IMPLEMENTED]** Audit logs and trails (in `/base`).
- **[PENDING]** Risk assessment history.

## Security Requirements

- **Data Integrity**
  - **[IMPLEMENTED]** Tamper-proof audit logs (in `/base`).
- **Privacy Protection**
  - **[PARTIALLY IMPLEMENTED]** GDPR-compliant data handling (core reporting in `/base`).
