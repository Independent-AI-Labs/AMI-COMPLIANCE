# Compliance Module Research Artifacts

This directory stores historical configuration templates and documentation that pre-date
the streamlined compliance module. Files here are not active:
- Legacy environment/requirements files (`default.env`, `requirements*.txt`, `mypy.ini`,
  `pytest.ini`, `ruff.toml`).
- Former conformity and requirements reports (`CONFORMITY.md`, `REQUIREMENTS.md`).

Do not copy these files into new work without first reconciling them with the `/base`
standards and the simplified docs under `compliance/docs/`.
