# Compliance Module Research Artifacts

This directory keeps historical reports and requirement breakdowns that do not
reflect the current Base-aligned implementation. Configuration stubs (e.g.
legacy `requirements.txt`, `.ini` files) have been removed to avoid confusion.
Use the remaining documents strictly as background research; promote material
back into `compliance/docs/` only after it matches the live codebase.
