# Compliance Module Research Artifacts

This archive preserves the deep dives that shaped AMI's governance approachâ€”sector scans, standards mappings, and architectural experiments. Treat it as the knowledge base for future compliance features rather than production documentation.

Configuration skeletons (e.g. historical `requirements.txt`, `.ini` files) have been removed to avoid confusion. Use the remaining documents strictly as background research; promote material back into `compliance/docs/` only after it matches the live codebase.
