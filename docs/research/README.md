# Compliance Research Archive

This folder contains historical compliance analyses, detailed standards breakdowns, and
specifications that pre-date the Base-aligned implementation. Use these documents strictly as
research references. When converting any item into production work, migrate the relevant
content back into `/compliance/docs` and ensure it adheres to `/base` patterns (DataOps models,
FastMCP servers, audit logging, uv-based tooling).

Contents include:
- Standards catalogues and acquisition trackers
- Consolidated requirement breakdowns for EU AI Act, ISO/IEC 27001, ISO/IEC 42001, and NIST
- Draft backend specifications and implementation status notes
- Downloaded source standards (`compliance_standards/`)

Do not treat these documents as reflective of the current platform. Update the main
`compliance/docs/README.md` when shippable features land.
