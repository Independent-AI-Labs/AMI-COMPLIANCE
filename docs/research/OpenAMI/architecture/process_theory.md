# Process Theory and Cognitive Guarantees

This chapter condenses the theoretical constructs from the Open AMI report and links them to active compliance goals, aligning the framework with formal governance and assurance literature.[^nist-800-37][^seven-sketches]

## Process Theory

- Defines goals, actions, and learning transitions with embedded compliance checks, borrowing lifecycle controls from regulated system risk-management workflows.[^nist-800-37]
- Uses Compliance State Transitions (CSTs) to enforce mandatory pre/post conditions (`COMPLIANCE_BACKEND_SPEC.md` §"Runtime Services").
- Future runtime implementation: policy engines within `compliance/backend/runtime/` (**Planned**).

## Cognitive Mapping

- Category-theoretic abstraction for knowledge representation and provenance.[^seven-sketches]
- Aligns with consolidated documentation on traceability (e.g., `consolidated/EU_AI_Act/high_risk_ai_systems/requirements/record_keeping/`).
- Needs knowledge graph storage and reconciliation service — target location `base/backend/graph/` (**Research**).

## Atomic Reasoning Units (ARUs)

- Break complex reasoning into verifiable steps with integrity proofs, drawing on emerging zero-knowledge machine learning research.[^zkml]
- Proposed integration with zero-knowledge tooling described in `systems/secure_distributed_system.md`.
- Map to future MCP tools for step-trace export (**Planned**).

## Guidance Functions

- Formal constraints that steer agent behaviour within the Compliance Manifest and mirror guardrail concepts in the NIST AI Risk Management Framework.[^nist-ai-rmf]
- Implementation placeholder: compliance backend `guidance_service.py` to emit guard rails for orchestrated agents (**Research**).

## Emotional and Contextual Metadata

- Captures affective and situational signals that influence policy decisions.
- Source metadata must be logged with provenance tags for post-market monitoring.
- Future storage target: contextual ledger in `compliance/backend/context_service.py` (**Research**).

## Operational Self-Awareness

- Continuous monitoring of system state versus compliance objectives.
- Relies on SDS monitors and incident workflows mapped to EU AI Act Articles 72–73 (see consolidated incident reporting docs).
- Implementation hook: `compliance/backend/monitoring/` once backend exists (**Planned**).

## Multi-Component Collaboration

- Describes coordination protocols between agents while preserving manifest compliance, inspired by multi-agent orchestration patterns.[^autogen]
- Requires conflict resolution logic to merge directives and handle escalations.
- Proposed implementation: collaboration manager in compliance MCP (**Research**).
