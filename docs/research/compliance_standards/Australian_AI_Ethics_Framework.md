## The 8 AI Ethics Principles

### 1. Human, societal and environmental wellbeing
AI systems should benefit individuals, society and the environment.

### 2. Human-centred values
AI systems should respect human rights, diversity, and the autonomy of individuals.

### 3. Fairness
AI systems should be inclusive and accessible, and should not involve or result in unfair discrimination against individuals, communities or groups.

### 4. Privacy protection and security
AI systems should respect and uphold privacy rights and data protection, and ensure the security of data.

### 5. Reliability and safety
AI systems should reliably operate in accordance with their intended purpose.

### 6. Transparency and explainability
There should be transparency and responsible disclosure so people can understand when they are being significantly impacted by AI, and can find out when an AI system is engaging with them.

### 7. Contestability
When an AI system significantly impacts a person, community, group or environment, there should be a timely process to allow people to challenge the use or outcomes of the AI system.

### 8. Accountability
People responsible for the different phases of the AI system lifecycle should be identifiable and accountable for the outcomes of the AI systems, and human oversight of AI systems should be enabled.

## Implementation Context

These principles are voluntary and are designed to complement existing laws and regulations. They are intended to:
- Guide businesses and governments in the responsible design, development and implementation of AI
- Be sector-agnostic and apply broadly across different AI applications
- Support Australia's goal to be a global leader in responsible and inclusive AI
