# ISO/IEC 42001: Support

## Description

This clause of ISO/IEC 42001 specifies the requirements for the resources, competence, awareness, communication, and documented information needed for the AI Management System (AIMS).

## Legal Basis

This corresponds to **Clause 7** of the ISO/IEC 42001 standard.

## Key Elements

### 7.1 Resources

The organization must determine and provide the resources needed for the establishment, implementation, maintenance and continual improvement of the AIMS.

### 7.2 Competence

The organization must:

*   Determine the necessary competence of person(s) doing work under its control that affects its AI performance.
*   Ensure that these persons are competent on the basis of appropriate education, training, or experience.
*   Where applicable, take actions to acquire the necessary competence, and evaluate the effectiveness of the actions taken.
*   Retain documented information as evidence of competence and the results of training or development activities.

### 7.3 Awareness

Persons doing work under the organization's control must be aware of:

*   The AI policy.
*   Their contribution to the effectiveness of the AIMS, including the benefits of improved AI performance.
*   The implications of not conforming with the AIMS requirements.

### 7.4 Communication

The organization must determine the internal and external communications relevant to the AIMS, including what it will communicate, when to communicate, with whom to communicate, and how to communicate.

### 7.5 Documented information

The organizationâ€™s AIMS must include documented information required by the standard and documented information determined by the organization as being necessary for the effectiveness of the AIMS. This section also specifies requirements for creating, updating, and controlling documented information.

## Traces to Other Standards

*   **EU AI Act:** This clause aligns with several requirements in the EU AI Act, including:
    *   **Technical Documentation (Article 11 and Annex IV):** The requirement for documented information in ISO/IEC 42001 is a direct parallel to the technical documentation requirement in the EU AI Act.
    *   **Quality Management System (Article 17):** The QMS in the EU AI Act also requires documented information, as well as processes for ensuring competence and awareness.
    *   **Transparency and provision of information to deployers (Article 13):** The communication requirements in ISO/IEC 42001 are aligned with the transparency requirements in the EU AI Act.

*   **NIST AI RMF:** The Support clause is aligned with the **Govern** function of the NIST AI RMF, which also emphasizes the importance of documentation, communication, and having a skilled workforce. Specifically, it aligns with:
    *   **GOVERN 2.2: The organization's personnel and partners receive AI risk management training.**
    *   **GOVERN 4.2: Organizational teams document the risks and potential impacts... and they communicate about the impacts more broadly.**

*   **ISO/IEC 27001 (Information Security Management System):** This clause is identical in structure and intent to **Clause 7: Support** of ISO/IEC 27001.

*   **NIST RMF:** The Support clause is aligned with the **Prepare** step of the NIST RMF, which involves establishing the necessary resources and assigning roles and responsibilities.
