# High-Risk AI Systems Requirement: Record-Keeping

## Description

High-risk AI systems must technically allow for the automatic recording of events (logs) over the lifetime of the system. Logging underpins traceability, enables post-market monitoring, and supports investigations into incidents or substantial modifications.

## Legal Basis

The record-keeping obligations are established in **Article 12 of the EU AI Act**, with complementary retention rules in **Article 19** and cross-references to Articles 18 and 72.

## Key Elements

### Logging Capabilities

Logging capabilities shall enable the recording of events relevant for:

* **Identifying situations that may result in a risk** within the meaning of Article 79(1) or indicate a substantial modification.
* **Facilitating post-market monitoring** (Article 72) by supplying operational data and performance evidence.
* **Monitoring the operation** of high-risk AI systems, including those referred to in Article 26(5).

### Retention and Control of Logs

* **Providers** must keep the logs that are automatically generated by their high-risk AI systems, to the extent those logs are under their control, for a period that is appropriate to the intended purpose of the system and **at least six months**, unless Union or national law mandates a longer retention period (Article 19(1)).
* **Deployers** who control log generation must retain logs for at least six months and comply with data-protection requirements. They must also make logs available to providers and competent authorities as part of the post-market monitoring system (Articles 12(2) and 72).
* Logs, technical documentation (Article 11), and quality-management evidence (Article 17) must remain accessible for **10 years** after the system is placed on the market or put into service (Article 18).

### Specific Logging Requirements for Biometric Systems

For high-risk AI systems for remote biometric identification of natural persons (Annex III, point 1(a)), the logging capabilities shall provide, at a minimum:

* **Recording the period of each use of the system** (start and end date and time).
* **Documenting the reference database** against which input data has been checked.
* **Capturing input data that produced a match.**
* **Identifying the natural persons** involved in verifying the results, as required by Article 14(5).

## Traces to Other Standards

* **NIST AI RMF:** Reinforces the **Govern** (policy and accountability for logging) and **Measure** (monitoring, TEVV evidence) functions; ongoing risk tracking in MEASURE 3 relies on retained logs.
* **ISO/IEC 42001 (AI Management System):** Aligns with Annex A controls such as **A.6.2.8 (AI system recording of event logs)**, **A.9.3 (Responsible use objectives)** and the retention guidance in Clauses 7.5 and 8.2.
* **ISO/IEC 27001 (Information Security Management System):** Mirrors Annex A controls **8.15 Logging** and **8.16 Monitoring activities**, and supports Clause 7.5 documentation retention and Clause 9 performance evaluation.
* **NIST RMF:** Integral to continuous monitoring (M-1 to M-5) and supports risk response (M-3) by ensuring evidentiary logs remain available to authorising officials.
