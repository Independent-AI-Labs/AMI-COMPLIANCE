# Prohibited AI Practice: Subliminal Techniques

## Description

This prohibition targets AI systems that use subliminal techniques to manipulate human behavior. These are techniques that work beyond a person's consciousness to materially distort their behavior in a way that is likely to cause significant harm.

## Legal Basis

This practice is prohibited under **Article 5(1)(a) of the EU AI Act**.

## Key Elements

*   **Subliminal Techniques:** The AI system deploys techniques that are beyond a person's consciousness.
*   **Manipulative or Deceptive:** The techniques are purposefully manipulative or deceptive.
*   **Material Distortion of Behavior:** The system's objective or effect is to materially distort a person's or a group's behavior.
*   **Impaired Decision-Making:** The manipulation appreciably impairs the person's ability to make an informed decision.
*   **Causation of Harm:** The distorted behavior causes or is reasonably likely to cause significant harm to that person, another person, or a group of persons.

## Traces to Other Standards

*   **NIST AI RMF:** This aligns with the core principles of fairness, accountability, and transparency in the NIST AI Risk Management Framework. The use of subliminal techniques would be a clear violation of these principles.
*   **ISO/IEC 42001:** This would likely be considered a misuse of an AI system under ISO/IEC 42001, which emphasizes the importance of ethical and trustworthy AI.
