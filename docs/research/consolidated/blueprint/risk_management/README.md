# Blueprint: Risk Management

## Introduction

Risk management underpins every major AI and information-security standard. This blueprint synthesises the requirements from the EU AI Act, NIST AI RMF, ISO/IEC 42001, ISO/IEC 27001 and the NIST RMF into a unified, lifecycle-oriented process.

## Unified Risk Management Process

Implement the following cycle continuously across the AI system lifecycle.

### 1. Establish the Context

* **Objective:** Understand the organisational environment and define the scope for risk management.
* **Activities:** Determine risk tolerance, clarify the system’s intended purpose, identify stakeholders and expectations, and confirm ISMS/AIMS scope boundaries.
* **Traces:**
  * [ISO/IEC 42001: Context of the Organization](../../iso_42001/context_of_the_organization/)
  * [ISO/IEC 27001: Context of the Organization](../../iso_27001/context_of_the_organization/)
  * [NIST AI RMF: Map](../../nist_ai_rmf/map/)
  * [NIST RMF: Prepare](../../nist_rmf/prepare/)

### 2. Identify Risks

* **Objective:** Surface known and reasonably foreseeable risks to health, safety, fundamental rights and information security.
* **Activities:** Catalogue threats, vulnerabilities, and impacts across intended use and reasonably foreseeable misuse; consider societal and environmental consequences.
* **Traces:**
  * [EU AI Act: Risk Management System](../../EU_AI_Act/high_risk_ai_systems/requirements/risk_management_system/)
  * [NIST AI RMF: Map](../../nist_ai_rmf/map/)
  * [ISO/IEC 42001: Planning](../../iso_42001/planning/)
  * [ISO/IEC 27001: Planning](../../iso_27001/planning/)
  * [NIST RMF: Categorize](../../nist_rmf/categorize/)

### 3. Analyse and Evaluate Risks

* **Objective:** Measure likelihood and impact, then prioritise risks against defined criteria.
* **Activities:** Apply the organisation’s risk assessment methodologies, update risk registers, and identify residual risk levels requiring treatment or acceptance.
* **Traces:**
  * [EU AI Act: Risk Management System](../../EU_AI_Act/high_risk_ai_systems/requirements/risk_management_system/)
  * [NIST AI RMF: Measure](../../nist_ai_rmf/measure/)
  * [ISO/IEC 42001: Planning](../../iso_42001/planning/)
  * [ISO/IEC 27001: Planning](../../iso_27001/planning/)
  * [NIST RMF: Assess](../../nist_rmf/assess/)

### 4. Treat Risks

* **Objective:** Select, implement and document risk treatment measures.
* **Activities:** Choose treatment options, design and implement controls, document Statements of Applicability, and coordinate change management across providers, deployers and supply-chain partners.
* **Traces:**
  * [EU AI Act: Risk Management System](../../EU_AI_Act/high_risk_ai_systems/requirements/risk_management_system/)
  * [EU AI Act: Obligations for Economic Operators](../../EU_AI_Act/high_risk_ai_systems/obligations/README.md)
  * [NIST AI RMF: Manage](../../nist_ai_rmf/manage/)
  * [ISO/IEC 42001: Operation](../../iso_42001/operation/)
  * [ISO/IEC 27001: Operation](../../iso_27001/operation/)
  * [NIST RMF: Select](../../nist_rmf/select/)
  * [NIST RMF: Implement](../../nist_rmf/implement/)

### 5. Monitor and Review

* **Objective:** Continuously verify control effectiveness and update the risk posture.
* **Activities:** Monitor system performance, track context changes, run audits and management reviews, feed insights into post-market monitoring, and execute corrective actions.
* **Traces:**
  * [EU AI Act: Post-Market Monitoring](../../EU_AI_Act/high_risk_ai_systems/requirements/post_market_monitoring/post_market_monitoring.md)
  * [NIST AI RMF: Measure](../../nist_ai_rmf/measure/)
  * [ISO/IEC 42001: Performance Evaluation](../../iso_42001/performance_evaluation/)
  * [ISO/IEC 27001: Performance Evaluation](../../iso_27001/performance_evaluation/)
  * [NIST RMF: Monitor](../../nist_rmf/monitor/)
