# Blueprint: Human Oversight

## Introduction

Human oversight is a critical safeguard for ensuring that AI systems are used safely and responsibly. It involves ensuring that humans can effectively monitor, understand, and intervene in the operation of AI systems. This document provides a synthesized view of the human oversight requirements from the EU AI Act and the NIST AI RMF.

## Unified Human Oversight Process

The following is a unified process for implementing human oversight that integrates the requirements from the relevant standards.

### 1. Design for Human Oversight

*   **Objective:** To design and develop AI systems in a way that enables effective human oversight.
*   **Activities:**
    *   Design appropriate human-machine interface tools.
    *   Implement mechanisms to allow for human intervention (e.g., a 'stop' button).
*   **Traces:**

    *   [NIST AI RMF: Govern](../../nist_ai_rmf/govern/)

### 2. Empower Human Overseers

*   **Objective:** To ensure that the persons assigned to human oversight are empowered to carry out their roles effectively.
*   **Activities:**
    *   Provide training on the capabilities and limitations of the AI system.
    *   Raise awareness of automation bias.
    *   Ensure that overseers have the authority to disregard, override, or reverse the output of the AI system.
