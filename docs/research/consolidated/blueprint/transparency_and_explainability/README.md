# Blueprint: Transparency and Explainability

## Introduction

Transparency and explainability are crucial for building trust in AI systems. Users and other stakeholders need to understand how AI systems make decisions, especially when those decisions have a significant impact on their lives. This document provides a synthesized view of the transparency and explainability requirements from the EU AI Act and the NIST AI RMF.

## Unified Transparency and Explainability Process

The following is a unified process for achieving transparency and explainability that integrates the requirements from the relevant standards.

### 1. Provide Clear and Complete Information

*   **Objective:** To provide users and other stakeholders with clear and complete information about the AI system.
*   **Activities:**
    *   Document the intended purpose, capabilities, and limitations of the AI system.
    *   Provide clear instructions for use.
    *   Explain how the AI system makes decisions in a way that is understandable to the target audience.
*   **Traces:**
    *   [EU AI Act: Transparency and Provision of Information to Deployers](../../EU_AI_Act/high_risk_ai_systems/requirements/transparency_and_information_for_deployers/)
    *   [NIST AI RMF: Govern](../../nist_ai_rmf/govern/)

### 2. Document the System

*   **Objective:** To create and maintain comprehensive technical documentation for the AI system.
*   **Activities:**
    *   Document the design and development process.
    *   Document the data used to train, validate, and test the system.
    *   Document the performance of the system.
*   **Traces:**
    *   [EU AI Act: Technical Documentation](../../EU_AI_Act/high_risk_ai_systems/requirements/technical_documentation/)
    *   [NIST AI RMF: Map](../../nist_ai_rmf/map/)

### 3. Keep Records

*   **Objective:** To automatically record events (logs) over the lifetime of the system.
*   **Activities:**
    *   Log events relevant for identifying risks and monitoring the system.
    *   Ensure the traceability of the system's functioning.
*   **Traces:**
    *   [EU AI Act: Record-Keeping](../../EU_AI_Act/high_risk_ai_systems/requirements/record_keeping/)
    *   [NIST AI RMF: Measure](../../nist_ai_rmf/measure/)
