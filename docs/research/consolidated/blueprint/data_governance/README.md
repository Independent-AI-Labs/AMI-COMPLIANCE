# Blueprint: Data Governance

## Introduction

Data is the lifeblood of AI systems. Effective data governance is essential for ensuring that AI systems are accurate, reliable, and fair. This document provides a synthesized view of the data governance requirements from the EU AI Act, NIST AI RMF, and ISO/IEC 42001.

## Unified Data Governance Process

The following is a unified data governance process that integrates the requirements from all the relevant standards.

### 1. Data Collection and Sourcing

*   **Objective:** To ensure that data is collected and sourced in a legal, ethical, and responsible manner.
*   **Activities:**
    *   Define the data requirements for the AI system.
    *   Identify and document the origin of the data (provenance).
    *   Ensure that data collection practices are fair and do not introduce bias.
*   **Traces:**
    *   [EU AI Act: Data and Data Governance](../../EU_AI_Act/high_risk_ai_systems/requirements/data_and_data_governance/)
    *   [ISO/IEC 42001: Annex A.7.3 Data acquisition](../../iso_42001/operation/)

### 2. Data Preparation and Quality

*   **Objective:** To ensure that data is accurate, complete, and relevant for the intended purpose.
*   **Activities:**
    *   Perform data cleaning, annotation, and enrichment.
    *   Assess the quality of the data.
    *   Identify and mitigate biases in the data.
*   **Traces:**
    *   [EU AI Act: Data and Data Governance](../../EU_AI_Act/high_risk_ai_systems/requirements/data_and_data_governance/)
    *   [ISO/IEC 42001: Annex A.7.5 Data preparation](../../iso_42001/operation/)
    *   [ISO/IEC 42001: Annex A.7.4 Quality of data for AI systems](../../iso_42001/operation/)

### 3. Data Management and Security

*   **Objective:** To ensure that data is managed and protected throughout its lifecycle.
*   **Activities:**
    *   Classify data based on its sensitivity.
    *   Implement appropriate security controls to protect the data.
    *   Define and implement data retention and deletion policies.
*   **Traces:**
    *   [ISO/IEC 27001: Annex A.5.12 Classification of information](../../iso_27001/operation/)
    *   [ISO/IEC 27001: Annex A.8.10 Information deletion](../../iso_27001/operation/)
