## The Eight AI Ethics Principles

### 1. Human, Societal and Environmental Wellbeing
**Core Requirement:** AI systems should benefit individuals, society and the environment throughout their lifecycle.

**Key Considerations:**
- Net benefit assessment
- Stakeholder impact analysis
- Environmental sustainability
- Long-term societal effects
- Alignment with UN Sustainable Development Goals

**Key Considerations:**
- Human rights impact assessment
- Respect for human dignity
- Cultural sensitivity
- Individual autonomy preservation
- Diversity and inclusion by design

### 3. Fairness
**Core Requirement:** AI systems should be inclusive and accessible, and should not involve or result in unfair discrimination.

**Key Considerations:**
- Bias detection and mitigation
- Inclusive design principles
- Accessibility standards (WCAG compliance)
- Equity impact assessment
- Procedural and distributive fairness

### 4. Privacy Protection and Security
**Core Requirement:** AI systems should respect and uphold privacy rights and data protection, ensuring security of data.

**Key Considerations:**
- Privacy by design
- Data minimisation
- Security controls
- Compliance with Privacy Act 1988
- Cross-border data considerations

### 5. Reliability and Safety
**Core Requirement:** AI systems should reliably operate in accordance with their intended purpose.

**Key Considerations:**
- Testing and validation
- Failure mode analysis
- Safety assurance cases
- Performance monitoring
- Incident response procedures

### 6. Transparency and Explainability
**Core Requirement:** There should be transparency and responsible disclosure about AI systems.

**Key Considerations:**
- AI disclosure requirements
- Explainable AI techniques
- Stakeholder communication
- Documentation standards
- Audit trails

### 7. Contestability
**Core Requirement:** People should be able to challenge AI system use or outcomes.

**Key Considerations:**
- Appeal mechanisms
- Human review processes
- Feedback channels
- Remediation procedures
- Timely response requirements

### 8. Accountability
**Core Requirement:** People responsible for AI systems should be identifiable and accountable.

**Key Considerations:**
- Clear responsibility assignment
- Governance structures
- Human oversight mechanisms
- Liability frameworks
- Compliance monitoring

## Relationship to Australian Law

## Implementation Approach

### Risk-Based Framework
1. **Risk Identification**
   - Stakeholder mapping
   - Impact assessment
   - Likelihood evaluation

2. **Risk Categorisation**
   - Low risk: Standard controls
   - Medium risk: Enhanced measures
   - High risk: Comprehensive assurance

3. **Control Implementation**
   - Technical controls
   - Organisational measures
   - Governance structures

4. **Monitoring and Review**
   - Continuous monitoring
   - Regular audits
   - Stakeholder feedback

### Governance Model

**Three Lines of Defence:**

1. **First Line - Operational**
   - Development teams

   - Compliance functions
   - Quality assurance

3. **Third Line - Assurance**
   - Internal audit
   - External assessment
   - Independent review
