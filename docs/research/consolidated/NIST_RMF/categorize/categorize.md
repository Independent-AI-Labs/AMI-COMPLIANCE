# NIST RMF: Categorize

## Description

The purpose of the Categorize step is to inform organizational risk management processes and tasks by determining the adverse impact to organizational operations and assets, individuals, other organizations, and the Nation with respect to the loss of confidentiality, integrity, and availability of organizational systems and the information processed, stored, and transmitted by those systems.

## Key Elements

*   **C-1: System Description:** Document the characteristics of the system.
*   **C-2: Security Categorization:** Categorize the system and the information processed by the system based on an analysis of the impact of loss.
*   **C-3: Security Categorization Review and Approval:** Review and approve the security categorization results and decision.

## Traces to Other Standards

*   **EU AI Act:** The Categorize step is related to the **classification of high-risk AI systems (Article 6)**. While the EU AI Act has a specific list of high-risk systems, the principle of categorizing systems based on risk is aligned. The impact assessment performed in the Categorize step is a key input to determining if an AI system is high-risk.

*   **NIST AI RMF:** This step is aligned with the **Map** function of the NIST AI RMF, which involves categorizing the AI system and understanding its potential impacts. Specifically, it aligns with:
    *   **MAP 2: Categorization of the AI system is performed.**
    *   **MAP 5: Impacts to individuals, groups, communities, organizations, and society are characterized.**

*   **ISO/IEC 42001 & ISO/IEC 27001:** The Categorize step is a key input to the **Planning (Clause 6)** process in both ISO/IEC 42001 and ISO/IEC 27001, as it helps to determine the scope and intensity of the risk management activities. The categorization of information is also a key control in **Annex A.5.12** of ISO/IEC 27001.
