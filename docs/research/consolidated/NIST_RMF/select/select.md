# NIST RMF: Select

## Description

The purpose of the Select step is to select, tailor, and document the controls necessary to protect the information system and organization commensurate with risk to organizational operations and assets, individuals, other organizations, and the Nation.

## Key Elements

*   **S-1: Control Selection:** Select the controls for the system and the environment of operation.
*   **S-2: Control Tailoring:** Tailor the controls selected for the system and the environment of operation.
*   **S-3: Control Allocation:** Allocate security and privacy controls to the system and to the environment of operation.
*   **S-4: Documentation of Planned Control Implementations:** Document the controls for the system and environment of operation in security and privacy plans.
*   **S-5: Continuous Monitoring Strategyâ€”System:** Develop and implement a system-level strategy for monitoring control effectiveness.
*   **S-6: Plan Review and Approval:** Review and approve the security and privacy plans.

## Traces to Other Standards

*   **EU AI Act:** The Select step is aligned with the **Risk Management System (Article 9)** requirement in the EU AI Act, which requires the adoption of appropriate and targeted risk management measures. The selection of controls is a key part of this process. The documentation of the controls in security and privacy plans is also aligned with the **Technical Documentation (Article 11)** requirement.

*   **NIST AI RMF:** This step is aligned with the **Manage** function of the NIST AI RMF, which involves prioritizing and responding to risks. Specifically, it aligns with:
    *   **MANAGE 1.2: Treatment of documented AI risks is prioritized based on impact, likelihood, and available resources or methods.**
    *   **MANAGE 1.3: Responses to the AI risks deemed high priority...are developed, planned, and documented.**

*   **ISO/IEC 42001 & ISO/IEC 27001:** The Select step is a key part of the **Planning (Clause 6)** and **Operation (Clause 8)** clauses in both ISO/IEC 42001 and ISO/IEC 27001. It involves selecting and implementing controls to address identified risks. The Statement of Applicability in ISO/IEC 27001 is a direct output of this step.
