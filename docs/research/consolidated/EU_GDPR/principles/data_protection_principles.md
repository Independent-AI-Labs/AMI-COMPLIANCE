- Clear communication with data subjects
- No hidden or misleading processing

**(b) Purpose limitation**
- Collected for specified, explicit and legitimate purposes
- Not further processed incompatibly with those purposes
- Exception for archiving, scientific/historical research, statistical purposes

**(c) Data minimisation**
- Adequate, relevant and limited to what is necessary
- Only process data actually needed for specified purposes
- Regular review and deletion of unnecessary data

**(d) Accuracy**
- Personal data shall be accurate and kept up to date
- Inaccurate data must be erased or rectified without delay
- Procedures for data subjects to update information

**(e) Storage limitation**
- Kept in identifiable form no longer than necessary
- Retention periods must be defined and justified
- Regular review and deletion processes required

**(f) Integrity and confidentiality**
- Processed securely using appropriate technical/organisational measures
- Protection against unauthorised/unlawful processing

- Ability to provide evidence to supervisory authorities

### Article 6 - Lawfulness of processing

Processing lawful only if at least one applies:

6. **Legitimate interests** - Except where overridden by data subject rights

### Article 7 - Conditions for consent

- Demonstrable consent required
- Clear, plain language request
- Distinguishable from other matters
- Withdrawal as easy as giving consent
- No detriment for refusal/withdrawal

### Article 8 - Child's consent (information society services)

- Age 16 for consent (Member States may lower to 13)

- Reasonable efforts to verify parental responsibility

### Article 9 - Special categories of personal data

**Prohibited processing of:**
- Racial or ethnic origin

### Article 11 - Processing not requiring identification

- If purposes don't require identification, no obligation to maintain identifying information
- But cannot refuse to accept additional information from data subject to exercise rights

## Implementation Requirements for AI Systems

### For AI Training Data
1. **Purpose Specification**
   - Document specific AI training purposes
   - Ensure alignment with original collection purposes
   - Consider scientific research exemption applicability

2. **Data Minimisation in ML**
   - Feature selection and dimensionality reduction
   - Sampling strategies for large datasets
   - Regular assessment of data necessity

3. **Accuracy in AI Context**
   - Data quality assessment procedures
   - Bias detection and mitigation
   - Regular model retraining with updated data

4. **Storage Limitation for Models**
   - Define retention for training data vs models
   - Implement data deletion from trained models
   - Document justification for long-term retention

### For AI Operations
1. **Transparency**
   - Explainable AI mechanisms
   - Clear information about AI decision-making
   - Accessible privacy notices

2. **Fairness**
   - Bias testing and mitigation
   - Regular fairness audits
   - Documented fairness metrics

3. **Security**
   - Model security (adversarial robustness)
   - Secure multi-party computation where applicable
   - Differential privacy techniques

## Traces to Other Standards

### EU AI Act
- Article 10 (Data and data governance) builds on GDPR principles
- Article 13 (Transparency) aligns with GDPR transparency requirements

### ISO/IEC 27701
- 7.2 (Principles) maps directly to GDPR Article 5
- 7.3 (Lawful basis) implements Article 6 requirements

### NIST Privacy Framework
- Identify-P function covers data processing principles
- Govern-P function addresses accountability

### ISO/IEC 42001
- Clause 6.1.3 (AI system impact assessment) incorporates data protection principles
- Annex B controls for data governance align with GDPR principles
