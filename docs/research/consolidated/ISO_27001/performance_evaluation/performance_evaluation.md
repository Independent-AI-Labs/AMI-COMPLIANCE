# ISO/IEC 27001: Performance Evaluation

## Description

Clause 9 requires organisations to monitor, measure, analyse and evaluate ISMS performance, conduct internal audits, and perform management reviews.

## Key Elements

### 9.1 Monitoring, Measurement, Analysis and Evaluation

* Determine what needs to be monitored and measured (e.g. control effectiveness, process performance), the methods to use, when activities occur, and who is responsible.
* Ensure monitoring and measurement methods produce valid, comparable and reproducible results.
* Analyse and evaluate results at defined intervals and retain documented evidence.

### 9.2 Internal Audit

* Plan, establish, implement and maintain an audit programme, considering process importance and past results.
* Define audit criteria and scope for each audit, select objective auditors, conduct audits impartially, and report findings to relevant management.
* Retain documented information on the audit programme and results, and track completion of corrective actions.

### 9.3 Management Review

* Top management reviews the ISMS at planned intervals to confirm suitability, adequacy and effectiveness.
* Inputs include: status of previous actions; changes in internal/external issues; stakeholder requirements; performance trends (nonconformities, corrective actions, monitoring results, audit findings, objective achievement); feedback from interested parties; risk assessment results and treatment status; and opportunities for improvement.
* Outputs must document decisions and actions related to improvement opportunities, ISMS changes, resource needs and any required updates to objectives or risk criteria.

## Traces to Other Standards

* **EU AI Act:** Provides evidence for post-market monitoring (Article 72) and supports corrective action obligations (Article 20).
* **ISO/IEC 42001:** Clause 9 requirements mirror these processes, allowing integrated ISMS/AIMS reviews and audits.
* **NIST AI RMF / NIST RMF:** Aligns with MEASURE 3â€“4 (tracking and feedback) and RMF Monitor (continuous monitoring, reporting, authorisation updates).
