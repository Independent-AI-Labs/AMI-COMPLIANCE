# ISO/IEC 27001: Planning

## Description

Clause 6 defines how organisations plan their ISMS, address risks and opportunities, and set information security objectives.

## Key Elements

### 6.1 Actions to Address Risks and Opportunities

* Consider contextual issues (Clause 4.1) and stakeholder requirements (Clause 4.2) to identify risks and opportunities that could affect the ISMS.
* Plan actions to address these items and integrate them into ISMS processes, then evaluate their effectiveness.

#### 6.1.2 Information Security Risk Assessment

Organisations must define and apply a risk assessment process that:

* **Establishes risk criteria**, including acceptance thresholds and assessment criteria.
* Ensures assessments are consistent, valid and comparable over time.
* **Identifies risks** associated with confidentiality, integrity and availability, and assigns risk owners.
* **Analyses risks** by evaluating consequences and likelihood to determine risk levels.
* **Evaluates risks** against the criteria and prioritises them for treatment.
* Maintains documented information on both the process and assessment results.

#### 6.1.3 Information Security Risk Treatment

The risk treatment process must:

* Select appropriate treatment options based on assessment results.
* Determine the controls necessary to implement those options.
* **Compare chosen controls with Annex A** to ensure no required controls are omitted.
* Produce and maintain a **Statement of Applicability (SoA)** that lists the necessary controls, justifies their inclusion or exclusion, and describes their implementation status.
* Document the risk treatment plan and obtain management approval.
* Ensure risk owners approve the treatment plan and formally accept the residual risks before implementation.

### 6.2 Information Security Objectives and Planning to Achieve Them

* Establish measurable objectives at relevant functions and levels, aligned with the policy.
* Define who is responsible, what resources are needed, how progress is measured, and when results are reviewed.

## Traces to Other Standards

* **EU AI Act:** Provides the risk assessment and treatment structure that can be extended to AI-specific risks under Article 9 and cybersecurity requirements under Article 15.
* **ISO/IEC 42001:** Clause 6 mirrors these expectations for AI risk criteria, assessment and treatment, supporting integrated SoA development.
* **NIST AI RMF / NIST RMF:** Corresponds to Map (context and risk identification), Measure (metrics and analysis) and Manage (risk treatment) functions, and to the RMF Categorize, Select and Prepare steps.
