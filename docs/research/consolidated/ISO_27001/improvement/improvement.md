# ISO/IEC 27001: Improvement

## Description

Clause 10 focuses on continual improvement of the ISMS and the structured handling of nonconformities through corrective actions.

## Key Elements

### 10.1 Continual Improvement

* Continually improve the suitability, adequacy and effectiveness of the ISMS. Improvement activities should be driven by monitoring results, audits, incident learnings and management review decisions.

### 10.2 Nonconformity and Corrective Action

When a nonconformity occurs, organisations must:

1. React to the nonconformity, including controlling and correcting it and dealing with the consequences.
2. Evaluate the need for action to eliminate the cause(s) by reviewing the issue, determining root cause, and identifying similar potential nonconformities.
3. Implement corrective actions, review their effectiveness, and make necessary changes to the ISMS.
4. Retain documented information on the nature of nonconformities, the actions taken and the results of corrective action.

## Traces to Other Standards

* **EU AI Act:** Supports Article 20 corrective action obligations and feeds back into the risk management system mandated by Article 9.
* **ISO/IEC 42001:** Clause 10 mirrors these requirements for AI management systems, facilitating integrated corrective actions across ISMS and AIMS.
* **NIST AI RMF / NIST RMF:** Aligns with MANAGE 4 (continual improvement, incident response) and RMF Monitor (risk response and plan of action management).
