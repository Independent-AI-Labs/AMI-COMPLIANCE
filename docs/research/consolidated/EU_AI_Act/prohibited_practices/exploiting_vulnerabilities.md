# Prohibited AI Practice: Exploiting Vulnerabilities

## Description

This prohibition targets AI systems that exploit the vulnerabilities of a natural person or a specific group of persons. These vulnerabilities can be due to age, disability, or a specific social or economic situation. The objective or effect of such exploitation is to materially distort the behavior of a person in a manner that causes or is reasonably likely to cause that person or another person significant harm.

## Legal Basis

This practice is prohibited under **Article 5(1)(b) of the EU AI Act**.

## Key Elements

*   **Exploitation of Vulnerabilities:** The AI system exploits vulnerabilities of a person or a specific group of persons.
*   **Vulnerability Criteria:** The vulnerabilities can be based on age, disability, or a specific social or economic situation.
*   **Material Distortion of Behavior:** The objective or effect is to materially distort the behavior of the vulnerable person or group.
*   **Causation of Harm:** The distorted behavior causes or is reasonably likely to cause significant harm to the person or another person.

## Traces to Other Standards

*   **NIST AI RMF:** This practice is in direct conflict with the principles of fairness and non-discrimination in the NIST AI Risk Management Framework.
*   **ISO/IEC 42001:** This would be a clear violation of the ethical principles for AI systems outlined in ISO/IEC 42001, particularly the principle of fairness.
