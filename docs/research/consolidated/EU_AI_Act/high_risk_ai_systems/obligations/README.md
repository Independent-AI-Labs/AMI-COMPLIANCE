# High-Risk AI Systems: Obligations for Economic Operators

This section consolidates the duties imposed by the EU AI Act on the organisations that design, place on the market, distribute and use high-risk AI systems. These obligations complement the technical requirements in Section 2 of the Act and ensure accountability across the supply chain.

## Actors Covered

* [Providers](./providers.md)
* [Authorised Representatives](./authorised_representatives.md)
* [Importers](./importers.md)
* [Distributors](./distributors.md)
* [Deployers](./deployers.md)

These pages should be read together with the technical requirements (risk management, documentation, data governance, human oversight, etc.) and the [Post-Market Monitoring](../requirements/post_market_monitoring/post_market_monitoring.md) obligations that bind providers and deployers once a system is in service.
