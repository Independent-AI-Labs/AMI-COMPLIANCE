# Current Implementation Status Report
## AMI-ORCHESTRATOR Compliance Audit

**As of:** September 26, 2025  
**Maintainer:** Compliance Working Group

This report captures the delta between the consolidated requirements and the code currently in `main`. Percentages have been removed until the compliance backend exists; focus instead is on demonstrable capabilities and blockers.

## 1. Module Overview

### Base Module (`/base`)

**Strengths**
- `backend/dataops/security/audit_trail.py` implements blockchain-based immutable logging aligned with EU AI Act Article 12.
- DataOps layer (DAO factory, storage configs) provides a reusable persistence stack for compliance data.
- Existing MCP servers (`backend/mcp/*`) demonstrate the FastMCP integration pattern we will mirror.

**Gaps/Actions**
- No compliance-facing repositories or services yet; the audit trail is not exposed via compliance APIs.
- Risk treatment approval workflow (ISO/IEC 27001 Clause 6.1.3) still manual.

### Compliance Module (`/compliance`)

**Current State**
- Documentation only; no `backend/` package or runtime code.
- Consolidated requirements and new backend spec now in place.

**Immediate Actions**
- Scaffold `compliance/backend` per `COMPLIANCE_BACKEND_SPEC.md`.
- Create MCP server with read-only tooling (`get_control`, `list_gaps`) then iterate towards write workflows (`submit_evidence`).

### Browser, Files, Domains, Nodes, Streams, UX

- Security hardening and setup contracts are documented, but there is no automated feed of compliance status.
- Once compliance MCP exists, each module must register relevant evidence (e.g., browser isolation logs, UX accessibility checks).

## 2. Capability Snapshot

| Capability | Source Artifact | Status | Next Step |
|------------|-----------------|--------|-----------|
| Immutable audit logging | `base/backend/dataops/security/audit_trail.py` | Operational | Add compliance export tooling (Sprint 2). |
| Requirements library | `compliance/docs/consolidated/**` | Complete | Seed backend catalogue (Sprint 1). |
| Risk management | n/a | Missing | Implement `risk_service.py` (Sprint 3). |
| Evidence registry | n/a | Missing | Implement `evidence_service.py` (Sprint 3). |
| Compliance MCP server | n/a | Missing | Build per spec (Sprint 2). |
| Incident reporting | n/a | Missing | Integrate Article 73 workflow (Sprint 3). |

## 3. Critical Path

1. **Backend Scaffolding (Sprint 1)**
   - Deliver directory layout and base models.
   - Implement initial loader to map consolidated docs to control models.
2. **MCP MVP (Sprint 2)**
   - Publish read-only compliance insights leveraging static data.
   - Wire audit logging for every tool invocation.
3. **Evidence & Risk (Sprint 3)**
   - Enable submissions, approvals, incident tracking.
4. **Reporting & Automation (Sprint 4)**
   - Generate audit packets, sync status docs automatically, integrate with module setup scripts.

Progress should be logged back to `EXECUTIVE_ACTION_PLAN.md` and `SUBMODULE_COMPLIANCE_PLANS.md` after each sprint review.
