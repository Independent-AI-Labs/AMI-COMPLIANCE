# ISO/IEC 42001: Performance Evaluation

## Description

Clause 9 requires organisations to monitor and measure AIMS performance, run internal audits, and conduct management reviews to ensure the system remains effective and aligned with responsible AI objectives.

## Key Elements

### 9.1 Monitoring, Measurement, Analysis and Evaluation

* Determine what needs to be monitored and measured (e.g. AI risk indicators, control effectiveness, impact metrics), the methods to use, when monitoring occurs and who performs it.
* Ensure methods produce valid, comparable and reproducible results and retain documented evidence of outcomes.
* Use results to evaluate whether the AIMS achieves intended results and responsible AI objectives.

### 9.2 Internal Audit

* Establish and maintain an audit programme that considers process importance and previous audit outcomes.
* Define audit objectives, criteria and scope; select auditors who ensure objectivity; conduct audits impartially and report results to relevant managers.
* Maintain documented information on audit programmes, reports, corrective actions and follow-up status.

### 9.3 Management Review

* Top management reviews the AIMS at planned intervals.
* Inputs include: the status of actions from prior reviews; changes in external and internal issues (including stakeholder expectations and the organisation’s AI roles); information on AIMS performance and effectiveness such as monitoring trends, incident data, audit results and progress toward AI objectives; the adequacy of resources; the effectiveness of actions addressing risks and opportunities; and opportunities for improvement.
* Outputs should capture decisions and actions related to continual improvement, updates to the AIMS or objectives, and any resource needs identified during the review.

## Traces to Other Standards

* **EU AI Act:** Provides evidence for Article 72 post-market monitoring, supports Article 20 corrective actions and informs updates to technical documentation.
* **ISO/IEC 27001:** Mirrors Clause 9 requirements, enabling unified review cycles for ISMS and AIMS.
* **NIST AI RMF / NIST RMF:** Aligns with MEASURE 3–4 (tracking and feedback loops) and RMF Monitor (continuous assessment, reporting and authorisation decisions).
