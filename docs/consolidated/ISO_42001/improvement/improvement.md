# ISO/IEC 42001: Improvement

## Description

This clause of ISO/IEC 42001 specifies the requirements for the continual improvement of the AI Management System (AIMS). It also includes requirements for nonconformity and corrective action.

## Legal Basis

This corresponds to **Clause 10** of the ISO/IEC 42001 standard.

## Key Elements

### 10.1 Continual improvement

The organization must continually improve the suitability, adequacy and effectiveness of the AIMS.

### 10.2 Nonconformity and corrective action

When a nonconformity occurs, the organization must:

*   React to the nonconformity and, as applicable, take action to control and correct it, and deal with the consequences.
*   Evaluate the need for action to eliminate the cause(s) of the nonconformity, including whether similar nonconformities exist or could occur elsewhere, so that it does not recur.
*   Implement any action needed.
*   Review the effectiveness of any corrective action taken.
*   Make changes to the AIMS, if necessary.
*   Retain documented information describing the nonconformity, actions taken, and the results.

## Traces to Other Standards

*   **EU AI Act:** This clause is aligned with the **Quality Management System (Article 17)** requirement in the EU AI Act, which requires a process for corrective and preventive actions. The continual improvement aspect is also a key principle of the QMS.

*   **NIST AI RMF:** The Improvement clause is aligned with the overall iterative nature of the NIST AI RMF. The framework is designed to be a living document that is continuously improved as the understanding of AI risks evolves. The corrective action process is also a key part of the **Manage** function. Specifically, it aligns with:
    *   **MANAGE 4.2: Measurable activities for continual improvements are integrated into AI system updates.**
    *   **MANAGE 4.3: Incidents and errors are communicated to relevant AI actors...Processes for tracking, responding to, and recovering from incidents and errors are followed and documented.**

*   **ISO/IEC 27001 (Information Security Management System):** This clause is identical in structure and intent to **Clause 10: Improvement** of ISO/IEC 27001.

*   **NIST RMF:** This clause is aligned with the **Monitor** step of the NIST RMF, which involves responding to risk based on the results of ongoing monitoring activities (M-3).
