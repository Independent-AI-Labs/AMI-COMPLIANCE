# ISO/IEC 42001: Operation

## Description

Clause 8 addresses operational planning and control of AIMS processes, AI risk assessment and treatment activities, and AI system impact assessments.

## Key Elements

### 8.1 Operational Planning and Control

* Plan, implement and control AIMS processes to meet requirements and the actions defined in Clause 6.
* Establish criteria for processes and ensure they are carried out as planned, supported by documented information.
* **Control planned changes** and review unintended changes, mitigating any adverse impacts on AI risk.
* **Manage externally provided processes, products and services** that affect the AIMS or AI systems to ensure they remain under governance.

### 8.2 AI Risk Assessment

* Perform AI risk assessments according to 6.1.2 at planned intervals and when significant changes occur.
* Retain documented information on all risk assessment results for traceability and continuous improvement.

### 8.3 AI Risk Treatment

* Implement the AI risk treatment plan developed under 6.1.3 and verify effectiveness.
* When new risks emerge or treatment is ineffective, revisit the risk treatment process and update the plan.
* Maintain records demonstrating implemented controls and residual risk.

### 8.4 AI System Impact Assessment

* Conduct impact assessments per 6.1.4 at planned intervals or when significant changes are proposed.
* Retain documented results and ensure findings feed back into risk management, design decisions and stakeholder communications.

## Traces to Other Standards

* **EU AI Act:** Supports Article 9 risk management execution, Article 27 impact assessments and ongoing conformity (Articles 43â€“44).
* **ISO/IEC 27001:** Mirrors Clause 8 operational control requirements, facilitating integrated processes for AI and information security.
* **NIST AI RMF / NIST RMF:** Aligns with the Manage function (implementing risk treatments, change management) and RMF Implement/Assess steps.
