# ISO/IEC 42001: Context of the Organization

## Description

This clause of ISO/IEC 42001 requires an organization to understand its context, the needs and expectations of interested parties, and to determine the scope of its AI Management System (AIMS).

## Legal Basis

This corresponds to **Clause 4** of the ISO/IEC 42001 standard.

## Key Elements

### 4.1 Understanding the organization and its context

The organization must determine external and internal issues that are relevant to its purpose and that affect its ability to achieve the intended result(s) of its AIMS. Clause 4.1 specifically calls out consideration of environmental conditions, including the relevance of **climate change**, and requires the organization to evaluate the role it plays within the AI ecosystem (for example, developer, deployer, service provider) when assessing those issues.

### 4.2 Understanding the needs and expectations of interested parties

The organization must determine:

*   The interested parties that are relevant to the AIMS.
*   The relevant requirements of these interested parties.
*   Which of these requirements will be addressed through the AIMS.

### 4.3 Determining the scope of the AI management system

The organization must determine the boundaries and applicability of the AIMS to establish its scope. When determining the scope, the organization must consider the external and internal issues and the requirements of interested parties.

### 4.4 AI management system

The organization must establish, implement, maintain, and continually improve an AIMS, including the processes needed and their interactions, in accordance with the requirements of the standard.

## Traces to Other Standards

*   **EU AI Act:** This clause aligns with the general principles of the EU AI Act, which require a clear understanding of the AI system's intended purpose and the context in which it will be used. This is particularly relevant to the **Risk Management System (Article 9)** and **Technical Documentation (Article 11)** requirements. Understanding the context is a prerequisite for identifying risks and for providing complete and accurate technical documentation.

*   **NIST AI RMF:** This clause is highly aligned with the **Map** function of the NIST AI RMF, which focuses on establishing the context and understanding the risks related to that context. Specifically, it aligns with:
    *   **MAP 1: Context is established and understood.**
    *   **MAP 2: Categorization of the AI system is performed.**

*   **ISO/IEC 27001 (Information Security Management System):** This clause is identical in structure and intent to **Clause 4: Context of the organization** of ISO/IEC 27001.

*   **NIST RMF:** This clause is aligned with the **Prepare** step of the NIST RMF, which involves identifying the organization's context and priorities for risk management.
