# ISO/IEC 42001: Planning

## Description

Clause 6 specifies how organisations plan their AI Management System (AIMS), manage AI risks and opportunities, perform risk and impact assessments, and set AI objectives.

## Key Elements

### 6.1 Actions to Address Risks and Opportunities

* Consider contextual issues (Clause 4.1) and stakeholder expectations (Clause 4.2) to determine AI-related risks and opportunities.
* Establish and maintain **AI risk criteria** that distinguish acceptable from unacceptable risks and support assessment, treatment and impact evaluation.
* Plan actions to address identified risks and opportunities, integrate them into AIMS processes, and evaluate their effectiveness.
* Retain documented information describing the actions taken.

#### 6.1.2 AI Risk Assessment

The AI risk assessment process must:

* Align with the AI policy (Clause 5.2) and objectives (Clause 6.2).
* Produce consistent, valid and comparable results across repeated assessments.
* Identify risks that may help or hinder AI objectives, covering organisational, individual and societal impacts.
* Analyse risks by assessing potential consequences and likelihood, and determine risk levels.
* Evaluate risks against the criteria and prioritise them for treatment.
* Document the process and assessment results.

#### 6.1.3 AI Risk Treatment

The AI risk treatment process must:

* Select appropriate treatment options and determine controls needed to implement them.
* **Compare selected controls with Annex A** references and consider Annex B implementation guidance.
* Identify the need for additional controls beyond Annex A when required.
* Produce a **Statement of Applicability** that lists required controls, justifies inclusion/exclusion, notes applicability for specific AI systems, and references implementation status.
* Document the risk treatment plan and monitor its execution.

#### 6.1.4 AI System Impact Assessment

* Establish a process to evaluate potential consequences for individuals, groups and society resulting from AI development, provision or use.
* Conduct assessments at planned intervals and when significant changes occur, retaining documented results.

### 6.2 AI Objectives and Planning to Achieve Them

* Set measurable AI objectives consistent with the AI policy, taking applicable requirements into account.
* Define responsibilities, resources, timelines, evaluation methods and communication plans for each objective.

## Traces to Other Standards

* **EU AI Act:** Provides the risk and impact assessment structure necessary to meet Article 9 risk management and Article 27 fundamental rights impact assessments.
* **ISO/IEC 27001:** Mirrors Clause 6 risk assessment/treatment requirements, enabling a unified Statement of Applicability covering AI and information security controls.
* **NIST AI RMF / NIST RMF:** Aligns with the Map, Measure and Manage functions and the RMF Categorize, Select and Prepare steps.
