# NIST RMF: Authorize

## Description

The purpose of the Authorize step is to provide organizational accountability by requiring a senior management official to determine if the security and privacy risk (including supply chain risk) to organizational operations and assets, individuals, other organizations, or the Nation based on the operation of a system or the use of common controls, is acceptable.

## Key Elements

*   **R-1: Authorization Package:** Assemble the authorization package and submit the package to the authorizing official for an authorization decision.
*   **R-2: Risk Analysis and Determination:** Analyze and determine the risk from the operation or use of the system or the provision of common controls.
*   **R-3: Risk Response:** Identify and implement a preferred course of action in response to the risk determined.
*   **R-4: Authorization Decision:** Determine if the risk from the operation or use of the information system or the provision or use of common controls is acceptable.
*   **R-5: Authorization Reporting:** Report the authorization decision and any deficiencies in controls that represent significant security or privacy risk.

## Traces to Other Standards

*   **EU AI Act:** The Authorize step is conceptually aligned with the **Conformity Assessment (Chapter 3, Section 4)** and the **CE marking (Article 48)** requirements in the EU AI Act. The authorization decision in the RMF is a formal acceptance of risk, which is a prerequisite for placing a high-risk AI system on the market. The authorization package (R-1) is analogous to the technical documentation required by the Act.

*   **NIST AI RMF:** This step is aligned with the **Govern** function of the NIST AI RMF, which involves making risk-based decisions about AI systems. Specifically, it aligns with:
    *   **GOVERN 2.3: Executive leadership of the organization takes responsibility for decisions about risks associated with AI system development and deployment.**

*   **ISO/IEC 42001 & ISO/IEC 27001:** The Authorize step is a key part of the **Leadership (Clause 5)** and **Planning (Clause 6)** clauses in both ISO/IEC 42001 and ISO/IEC 27001. It represents the formal management approval to operate a system, which is a key aspect of the leadership and commitment required by these standards.
