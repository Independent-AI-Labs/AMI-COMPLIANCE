# NIST RMF: Assess

## Description

The purpose of the Assess step is to determine if the controls selected for implementation are implemented correctly, operating as intended, and producing the desired outcome with respect to meeting the security and privacy requirements for the system and the organization.

## Key Elements

*   **A-1: Assessor Selection:** Select the appropriate assessor or assessment team for the type of control assessment to be conducted.
*   **A-2: Assessment Plan:** Develop, review, and approve plans to assess implemented controls.
*   **A-3: Control Assessments:** Assess the controls in accordance with the assessment procedures described in assessment plans.
*   **A-4: Assessment Reports:** Prepare the assessment reports documenting the findings and recommendations from the control assessments.
*   **A-5: Remediation Actions:** Conduct initial remediation actions on the controls and reassess remediated controls.
*   **A-6: Plan of Action and Milestones:** Prepare the plan of action and milestones based on the findings and recommendations of the assessment reports.

## Traces to Other Standards

*   **EU AI Act:** The Assess step is aligned with the **Conformity Assessment (Chapter 3, Section 4)** requirements in the EU AI Act. The assessment of controls is a key part of demonstrating conformity with the Act's requirements. The preparation of assessment reports (A-4) and remediation actions (A-5) are also key inputs to the conformity assessment process.

*   **NIST AI RMF:** This step is aligned with the **Measure** function of the NIST AI RMF, which involves analyzing, assessing, and monitoring AI risks. Specifically, it aligns with:
    *   **MEASURE 1: Appropriate methods and metrics are identified and applied.**
    *   **MEASURE 2: AI systems are evaluated for trustworthy characteristics.**

*   **ISO/IEC 42001 & ISO/IEC 27001:** The Assess step is a key part of the **Performance Evaluation (Clause 9)** in both ISO/IEC 42001 and ISO/IEC 27001. It involves monitoring, measurement, analysis, and evaluation of the management system, including internal audits.
