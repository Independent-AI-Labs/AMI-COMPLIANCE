# NIST RMF: Prepare

## Description

The Prepare step is to carry out essential activities at the organization, mission and business process, and information system levels of the organization to help prepare the organization to manage its security and privacy risks using the Risk Management Framework.

## Key Elements

The Prepare step is broken down into tasks at the organization level and the system level.

### Organization-Level Tasks

*   **P-1: Risk Management Roles:** Identify and assign individuals to specific roles associated with security and privacy risk management.
*   **P-2: Risk Management Strategy:** Establish a risk management strategy for the organization that includes a determination of risk tolerance.
*   **P-3: Risk Assessment—Organization:** Assess organization-wide security and privacy risk and update the risk assessment results on an ongoing basis.
*   **P-4: Organizationally-Tailored Control Baselines and Cybersecurity Framework Profiles (Optional):** Establish, document, and publish organizationally-tailored control baselines and/or Cybersecurity Framework Profiles.
*   **P-5: Common Control Identification:** Identify, document, and publish organization-wide common controls that are available for inheritance by organizational systems.
*   **P-6: Impact-Level Prioritization (Optional):** Prioritize organizational systems with the same impact level.
*   **P-7: Continuous Monitoring Strategy—Organization:** Develop and implement an organization-wide strategy for continuously monitoring control effectiveness.

### System-Level Tasks

*   **P-8: Mission or Business Focus:** Identify the missions, business functions, and mission/business processes that the system is intended to support.
*   **P-9: System Stakeholders:** Identify stakeholders who have an interest in the design, development, implementation, assessment, operation, maintenance, or disposal of the system.
*   **P-10: Asset Identification:** Identify assets that require protection.
*   **P-11: Authorization Boundary:** Determine the authorization boundary of the system.
*   **P-12: Information Types:** Identify the types of information to be processed, stored, and transmitted by the system.
*   **P-13: Information Life Cycle:** Identify and understand all stages of the information life cycle for each information type.
*   **P-14: Risk Assessment—System:** Conduct a system-level risk assessment and update the risk assessment results on an ongoing basis.
*   **P-15: Requirements Definition:** Define the security and privacy requirements for the system and the environment of operation.
*   **P-16: Enterprise Architecture:** Determine the placement of the system within the enterprise architecture.
*   **P-17: Requirements Allocation:** Allocate security and privacy requirements to the system and to the environment of operation.
*   **P-18: System Registration:** Register the system with organizational program or management offices.

## Traces to Other Standards

*   **EU AI Act:** The Prepare step is highly aligned with the **Risk Management System (Article 9)** and **Quality Management System (Article 17)** requirements in the EU AI Act. The activities in the Prepare step are essential prerequisites for establishing a robust risk management process. For example, the risk management strategy (P-2) and organization-wide risk assessment (P-3) are fundamental inputs to the AI-specific risk management required by the Act.

*   **NIST AI RMF:** The Prepare step is strongly aligned with the **Govern** and **Map** functions of the NIST AI RMF. It involves establishing the governance structure and context for risk management. The tasks in the Prepare step provide the organizational context for the AI-specific activities in the NIST AI RMF.

*   **ISO/IEC 42001 & ISO/IEC 27001:** The Prepare step is aligned with the **Context of the Organization (Clause 4)**, **Leadership (Clause 5)**, and **Planning (Clause 6)** clauses of both ISO/IEC 42001 and ISO/IEC 27001. The Prepare step provides the foundational activities for establishing a management system in accordance with these standards.
