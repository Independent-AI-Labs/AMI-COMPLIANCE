# NIST RMF: Monitor

## Description

The purpose of the Monitor step is to maintain an ongoing situational awareness about the security and privacy posture of the information system and the organization in support of risk management decisions.

## Key Elements

*   **M-1: System and Environment Changes:** Monitor the information system and its environment of operation for changes that impact the security and privacy posture of the system.
*   **M-2: Ongoing Assessments:** Assess the controls implemented within and inherited by the system in accordance with the continuous monitoring strategy.
*   **M-3: Ongoing Risk Response:** Respond to risk based on the results of ongoing monitoring activities, risk assessments, and outstanding items in plans of action and milestones.
*   **M-4: Authorization Package Updates:** Update plans, assessment reports, and plans of action and milestones based on the results of the continuous monitoring process.
*   **M-5: Security and Privacy Reporting:** Report the security and privacy posture of the system to the authorizing official and other organizational officials on an ongoing basis.
*   **M-6: Ongoing Authorization:** Review the security and privacy posture of the system on an ongoing basis to determine whether the risk remains acceptable.
*   **M-7: System Disposal:** Implement a system disposal strategy and execute required actions when a system is removed from operation.

## Traces to Other Standards

*   **EU AI Act:** The Monitor step is aligned with the **Post-Market Monitoring (Article 72)** requirement in the EU AI Act, which requires providers to have a system in place to monitor the performance of their high-risk AI systems. The ongoing assessments (M-2) and risk response (M-3) are key parts of this process.

*   **NIST AI RMF:** This step is aligned with the **Measure** and **Manage** functions of the NIST AI RMF, which involve the continuous monitoring and management of AI risks. Specifically, it aligns with:
    *   **MEASURE 3: Mechanisms for tracking identified AI risks over time are in place.**
    *   **MANAGE 4: Risk treatments...are documented and monitored regularly.**

*   **ISO/IEC 42001 & ISO/IEC 27001:** The Monitor step is a key part of the **Performance Evaluation (Clause 9)** and **Improvement (Clause 10)** clauses in both ISO/IEC 42001 and ISO/IEC 27001. It involves monitoring, measurement, analysis, and evaluation of the management system, as well as continual improvement.
