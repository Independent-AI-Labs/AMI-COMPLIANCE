# NIST RMF: Implement

## Description

The purpose of the Implement step is to implement the controls in the security and privacy plans for the system and for the organization and to document in a baseline configuration, the specific details of the control implementation.

## Key Elements

*   **I-1: Control Implementation:** Implement the controls in the security and privacy plans.
*   **I-2: Update Control Implementation Information:** Document changes to planned control implementations based on the "as-implemented" state of controls.

## Traces to Other Standards

*   **EU AI Act:** The Implement step is aligned with the **Risk Management System (Article 9)** and **Quality Management System (Article 17)** requirements in the EU AI Act. The implementation of controls is a critical part of the overall risk management process and is a key aspect of the QMS.

*   **NIST AI RMF:** This step is aligned with the **Manage** function of the NIST AI RMF, which involves implementing the risk treatment plan. Specifically, it aligns with:
    *   **MANAGE 1.3: Responses to the AI risks deemed high priority...are developed, planned, and documented.**

*   **ISO/IEC 42001 & ISO/IEC 27001:** The Implement step is a key part of the **Operation (Clause 8)** in both ISO/IEC 42001 and ISO/IEC 27001. It involves implementing the controls identified in the planning phase.
