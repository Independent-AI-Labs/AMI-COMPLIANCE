# NIST AI RMF: Manage

## Description

The Manage function entails allocating risk resources to mapped and measured risks on a regular basis and as defined by the Govern function. Risk treatment comprises plans to respond to, recover from, and communicate about incidents or events.

## Key Elements

The Manage function is broken down into the following categories and subcategories:

### MANAGE 1: AI risks based on assessments and other analytical output from the MAP and MEASURE functions are prioritized, responded to, and managed.

*   **MANAGE 1.1:** A determination is made as to whether the AI system achieves its intended purposes and stated objectives and whether its development or deployment should proceed.
*   **MANAGE 1.2:** Treatment of documented AI risks is prioritized based on impact, likelihood, and available resources or methods.
*   **MANAGE 1.3:** Responses to the AI risks deemed high priority, as identified by the MAP function, are developed, planned, and documented.
*   **MANAGE 1.4:** Negative residual risks to both downstream acquirers of AI systems and end users are documented.

### MANAGE 2: Strategies to maximize AI benefits and minimize negative impacts are planned, prepared, implemented, documented, and informed by input from relevant AI actors.

*   **MANAGE 2.1:** Resources required to manage AI risks are taken into account – along with viable non-AI alternative systems, approaches, or methods – to reduce the magnitude or likelihood of potential impacts.
*   **MANAGE 2.2:** Mechanisms are in place and applied to sustain the value of deployed AI systems.
*   **MANAGE 2.3:** Procedures are followed to respond to and recover from a previously unknown risk when it is identified.
*   **MANAGE 2.4:** Mechanisms are in place and applied, and responsibilities are assigned and understood, to supersede, disengage, or deactivate AI systems that demonstrate performance or outcomes inconsistent with intended use.

### MANAGE 3: AI risks and benefits from third-party entities are managed.

*   **MANAGE 3.1:** AI risks and benefits from third-party resources are regularly monitored, and risk controls are applied and documented.
*   **MANAGE 3.2:** Pre-trained models which are used for development are monitored as part of AI system regular monitoring and maintenance.

### MANAGE 4: Risk treatments, including response and recovery, and communication plans for the identified and measured AI risks are documented and monitored regularly.

*   **MANAGE 4.1:** Post-deployment AI system monitoring plans are implemented, including mechanisms for capturing and evaluating input from users and other relevant AI actors, appeal and override, decommissioning, incident response, recovery, and change management.
*   **MANAGE 4.2:** Measurable activities for continual improvements are integrated into AI system updates and include regular engagement with interested parties, including relevant AI actors.
*   **MANAGE 4.3:** Incidents and errors are communicated to relevant AI actors, including affected communities. Processes for tracking, responding to, and recovering from incidents and errors are followed and documented.

## Traces to Other Standards

*   **EU AI Act:** The Manage function is closely related to the **risk management measures** described in the **Risk Management System (Article 9)** requirement of the EU AI Act. It also aligns with the **Post-Market Monitoring (Article 72)** requirement, as it involves responding to and recovering from incidents and continuously monitoring the AI system's performance. The determination of whether to proceed with development or deployment in MANAGE 1.1 is also related to the **Conformity Assessment (Chapter 3, Section 4)** process.

*   **ISO/IEC 42001 (AI Management System):** The Manage function is aligned with **Clause 8: Operation** and **Clause 10: Improvement** of ISO/IEC 42001. It involves implementing the risk treatment plan and taking corrective actions.

*   **ISO/IEC 27001 (Information Security Management System):** The Manage function is aligned with **Clause 8: Operation** and **Clause 10: Improvement** of ISO/IEC 27001, but with a focus on AI-specific risks.

*   **NIST RMF:** The Manage function is aligned with the **Implement**, **Assess**, and **Monitor** steps of the NIST RMF. It involves implementing controls, assessing their effectiveness, and monitoring the system on an ongoing basis.
