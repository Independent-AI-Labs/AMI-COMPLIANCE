# Prohibited AI Practice: Real-Time Remote Biometric Identification for Law Enforcement

## Description

Article 5 establishes a general prohibition on the use of real-time remote biometric identification systems in publicly accessible spaces for law-enforcement purposes. The ban reflects the high risk to fundamental rights, with only narrow, exhaustively listed exceptions where such use can be justified.

## Legal Basis

This practice is prohibited under **Article 5(1)(h) of the EU AI Act**, with safeguards and conditions for the limited exceptions detailed in **Article 5(2)â€“(4)**.

## Key Elements

* **Real-time remote biometric identification:** Systems that detect and identify individuals at a distance without their active involvement and in real time.
* **Publicly accessible spaces:** Applies to any space open to the public, regardless of ownership.
* **Law-enforcement purposes:** Covers use by police or other authorities empowered to enforce criminal law.

## Exceptions

Use is permitted only when it is **strictly necessary** to achieve one of the following objectives:

1. **Targeted searches** for specific victims of abduction, trafficking or sexual exploitation, or the search for missing persons.
2. **Prevention of a specific, substantial and imminent threat** to life or physical safety, or a genuine and present/foreseeable terrorist threat.
3. **Localization or identification of a suspect** sought for listed serious offences (Annex II) punishable by at least a four-year custodial sentence in the relevant Member State.

## Safeguards for Exceptional Use

Any deployment under the above exceptions must satisfy all of the following safeguards:

* **Necessity and proportionality assessment:** Authorities must consider the seriousness, probability and scale of the harm if the system is not used, and weigh the consequences for the rights and freedoms of all persons affected (Article 5(2)).
* **Context-bound limitations:** National law authorising the use must set temporal, geographic and personal limits. Use is allowed solely to confirm the identity of the specifically targeted individual.
* **Prior authorisation:** Each use requires a binding authorisation by a judicial authority or an independent administrative authority of the Member State where the deployment occurs. In duly justified urgent situations the system may be activated without prior authorisation, provided an authorisation is sought **within 24 hours** (Article 5(3)).
* **Fundamental rights impact assessment:** Law-enforcement authorities must complete the assessment referenced in Article 27 and register the system in the EU database under Article 49 before use. In urgent cases, registration must follow without undue delay.
* **Data handling:** If authorisation is subsequently refused, the system must be stopped immediately and all data, results and outputs from the unauthorised use must be discarded and deleted (Article 5(3)).
* **Transparency and oversight:** Member States must notify competent market surveillance authorities about each use and adhere to any national reporting obligations.

## Traces to Other Standards

* **NIST AI RMF:** Highlights the need for strong governance (GOVERN 1.1, 2.3) and risk management (MANAGE 2.4), ensuring override and disengagement capabilities are in place.
* **ISO/IEC 42001:** Reinforces Annex A controls on lawful, ethical use and impact assessments (A.9.1, A.9.3) and the obligation to document exceptional operations.
* **ISO/IEC 27001 / 27701:** Emphasises logging, access control and data deletion measures consistent with Annex A controls (8.10, 8.11) and privacy-management requirements when biometric data is processed.
