# Prohibited AI Practice: Social Scoring

## Description

This prohibition targets AI systems used for the evaluation or classification of natural persons or groups of persons over a certain period of time based on their social behavior or known, inferred, or predicted personal or personality characteristics. The social score leads to detrimental or unfavorable treatment in social contexts that are unrelated to the contexts in which the data was originally generated or collected, or the treatment is unjustified or disproportionate to their social behavior.

## Legal Basis

This practice is prohibited under **Article 5(1)(c) of the EU AI Act**.

## Key Elements

*   **Social Scoring:** The AI system evaluates or classifies natural persons or groups based on their social behavior or personal characteristics.
*   **Detrimental Treatment:** The social score leads to detrimental or unfavorable treatment.
*   **Unrelated Contexts:** The treatment occurs in social contexts unrelated to the original data collection.
*   **Unjustified or Disproportionate:** The detrimental treatment is unjustified or disproportionate to the social behavior.

## Traces to Other Standards

*   **NIST AI RMF:** This practice is in direct conflict with the principles of fairness, accountability, and transparency in the NIST AI Risk Management Framework.
*   **ISO/IEC 42001:** This would be a clear violation of the ethical principles for AI systems outlined in ISO/IEC 42001, particularly the principles of fairness and non-discrimination.
