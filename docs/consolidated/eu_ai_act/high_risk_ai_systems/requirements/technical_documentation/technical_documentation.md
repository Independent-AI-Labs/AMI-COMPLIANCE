# High-Risk AI Systems Requirement: Technical Documentation

## Description

The technical documentation of a high-risk AI system shall be drawn up before that system is placed on the market or put into service and shall be kept up-to-date. It must demonstrate that the high-risk AI system complies with the requirements of the EU AI Act.

## Legal Basis

The requirement for technical documentation is laid down in **Article 11 of the EU AI Act**, with the detailed content specified in **Annex IV**.

## Key Elements

The technical documentation shall contain at least the following information:

### 1. General Description of the AI System

*   Intended purpose, provider name, and system version.
*   Interaction with hardware and software.
*   Versions of relevant software or firmware.
*   How the system is placed on the market (e.g., software package, API).
*   Hardware on which the system is intended to run.
*   Photographs or illustrations showing external features.
*   User interface description.
*   Instructions for use.

### 2. Detailed Description of the AI System Elements and Development Process

*   Methods and steps for development, including use of pre-trained systems or tools.
*   Design specifications, including general logic, algorithms, and key design choices.
*   System architecture.
*   Data requirements, including datasheets describing training methodologies and data sets.
*   Assessment of human oversight measures.
*   Description of pre-determined changes to the system and its performance.
*   Validation and testing procedures, including metrics for accuracy, robustness, and cybersecurity.
*   Cybersecurity measures.

### 3. Monitoring, Functioning and Control

*   Detailed information about the monitoring, functioning and control of the AI system.

### 4. Performance Metrics

*   A description of the appropriateness of the performance metrics for the specific AI system.

### 5. Risk Management System

*   A detailed description of the risk management system in accordance with Article 9.

### 6. Lifecycle Changes

*   A description of relevant changes made by the provider to the system through its lifecycle.

### 7. Standards and Solutions

*   A list of the harmonised standards applied.
*   Where no harmonised standards have been applied, a detailed description of the solutions adopted to meet the requirements.

### 8. EU Declaration of Conformity

*   A copy of the EU declaration of conformity.

### 9. Post-Market Monitoring

*   A detailed description of the system in place to evaluate the AI system performance in the post-market phase.

## Traces to Other Standards

*   **NIST AI RMF:** The technical documentation requirements are aligned with the **Govern**, **Map**, **Measure**, and **Manage** functions of the NIST AI RMF, which all emphasize the importance of documentation for transparency and accountability.

*   **ISO/IEC 42001 (AI Management System):** The technical documentation is a key part of the documented information required by an AIMS. It is specifically mentioned in:
    *   **Clause 7.5: Documented information**
    *   **Annex A.6.2.3: Documentation of AI system design and development**
    *   **Annex A.6.2.7: AI system technical documentation**

*   **ISO/IEC 27001 (Information Security Management System):** While not specific to AI, ISO/IEC 27001 also has requirements for documented information that are relevant to the technical documentation of an AI system, especially regarding cybersecurity measures. See **Clause 7.5: Documented information**.

*   **NIST RMF:** The technical documentation is a key input to several steps in the NIST RMF, including:
    *   **Select:** The technical documentation is needed to select and tailor controls.
    *   **Implement:** The documentation guides the implementation of controls.
    *   **Assess:** The documentation is used to assess the effectiveness of controls.
    *   **Authorize:** The documentation is part of the authorization package.
