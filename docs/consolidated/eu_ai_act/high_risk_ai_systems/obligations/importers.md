# Obligations for Importers of High-Risk AI Systems

## Description

Importers ensure that third-country high-risk AI systems meet EU AI Act requirements before those systems enter the Union market. Article 23 prescribes the verification, documentation and cooperation tasks that importers must fulfil.

## Legal Basis

Importer duties are specified in **Article 23 of the EU AI Act**.

## Key Obligations

* **Pre-market verification:** Confirm that the provider performed the appropriate conformity assessment (Article 43), produced technical documentation (Article 11 and Annex IV), prepared an EU declaration of conformity (Article 47) and affixed the CE mark (Article 48).
* **Authorised representative check:** Ensure that a compliant authorised representative is appointed where required (Article 22(1)).
* **Market withholding:** Refrain from placing systems on the market when there is reason to believe they are non-compliant, falsified, or accompanied by falsified documentation; inform providers and market surveillance authorities if Article 79(1) risks exist.
* **Labelling:** Add the importer’s name, registered trade name or trade mark, and contact address on the system, packaging or accompanying documentation.
* **Storage and transport:** Guarantee that storage and transport conditions under the importer’s control do not jeopardise compliance with Section 2 requirements.
* **Record retention:** Keep copies of certificates (when a notified body is involved), instructions for use and the EU declaration of conformity for 10 years.
* **Regulatory cooperation:** Provide competent authorities with all requested information and documentation and ensure access to the technical documentation in an understandable language.

## Traces to Other Standards

* **ISO/IEC 42001 & 27001:** Aligns with supply-chain control clauses (Clause 8) and documentation retention (Clause 7.5), reinforcing traceability and custody.
* **NIST AI RMF / NIST RMF:** Supports GOVERN 6 (third-party risk) and RMF Prepare and Monitor steps focused on supply-chain assurance and coordinated incident response.
