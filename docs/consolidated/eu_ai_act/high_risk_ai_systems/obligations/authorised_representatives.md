# Obligations for Authorised Representatives

## Description

When a provider of a high-risk AI system is established outside the EU, it must appoint an authorised representative within the Union. Article 22 defines the mandatory tasks that the representative must be empowered to undertake on behalf of the provider.

## Legal Basis

The obligations of authorised representatives are laid down in **Article 22 of the EU AI Act**.

## Key Obligations

* **Mandated authority:** The authorised representative must receive a written mandate permitting it to perform the minimum tasks in Article 22(3), including holding documentation and communicating with authorities on the provider’s behalf.
* **Verify conformity evidence:** Prior to market placement, the representative must check that the EU declaration of conformity and technical documentation have been prepared and that the appropriate conformity assessment has been completed (Article 22(3)(a)).
* **Documentation retention:** Representatives keep the EU declaration of conformity, technical documentation and any notified-body certificate available for competent authorities for 10 years after market placement (Article 22(3)(b)).
* **Cooperation with authorities:** Upon reasoned request, the representative must supply competent authorities—in the EU official language they specify—with the mandate and supporting documentation needed to demonstrate conformity (Article 22(3)(c)).
* **Escalate unresolved non-compliance:** If the representative has reason to believe the provider is not complying with the EU AI Act, it must inform the provider and cooperate on corrective actions; if non-compliance persists, it must notify the relevant market surveillance authority and, where applicable, the notified body, and terminate the mandate (Article 22(3)(d) and 22(4)).
* **Registration accuracy:** Where responsible for database registration, the representative must fulfil Article 49(1) obligations or, if the provider registers the system, ensure the submitted information remains accurate (Article 22(3)(e)).

## Traces to Other Standards

* **ISO/IEC 42001 & 27001:** Documentation control, authority assignment and incident coordination correspond to Clauses 5 (leadership), 7.5 (documented information) and 10.2 (corrective action).
* **NIST AI RMF / NIST RMF:** Aligns with GOVERN 2 (accountability structures) and RMF Prepare (P-1, P-2) by ensuring a designated EU contact manages regulatory interactions and risk responses.
