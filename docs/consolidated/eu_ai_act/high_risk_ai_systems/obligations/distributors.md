# Obligations for Distributors of High-Risk AI Systems

## Description

Distributors make high-risk AI systems available on the EU market after import. Article 24 requires them to verify compliance signals and react to non-conformities while systems remain under their control.

## Legal Basis

Distributor obligations are set out in **Article 24 of the EU AI Act**.

## Key Obligations

* **Due diligence prior to distribution:** Check that CE marking is present, the EU declaration of conformity accompanies the system, and provider/importer obligations (Article 16(b)-(c) and Article 23(3)) are met.
* **Withhold non-compliant systems:** Do not distribute systems suspected of non-compliance until brought into conformity; notify providers/importers and authorities if Article 79(1) risks arise.
* **Storage and transport control:** Ensure conditions while the system is under distributor responsibility do not undermine compliance.
* **Corrective action coordination:** When non-compliance is detected post-distribution, coordinate with providers/importers to correct, withdraw or recall the system and inform authorities about actions taken.
* **Regulatory cooperation:** Provide competent authorities with information demonstrating compliance upon reasoned request and assist with risk mitigation efforts.

## Traces to Other Standards

* **ISO/IEC 42001 & 27001:** Supports Clause 8 obligations for controlling externally provided products/services and supply-chain risk treatment.
* **NIST AI RMF / NIST RMF:** Reinforces GOVERN 6 (third-party management) and RMF Monitor (M-1, M-3) through ongoing oversight and incident escalation.
