# Obligations for Providers of High-Risk AI Systems

## Description

Providers are primarily responsible for ensuring that high-risk AI systems comply with the EU AI Act before the systems are placed on the market or put into service. Article 16 sets out a comprehensive list of duties that span conformity assessment, technical documentation, quality management and incident response.

## Legal Basis

The provider obligations are defined in **Article 16 of the EU AI Act**.

## Key Obligations

* **Ensure compliance with Section 2 requirements:** Providers must verify that the high-risk AI system meets all mandatory requirements (risk management, data governance, technical documentation, etc.) before placing it on the market.
* **Labelling and contact details:** The providerâ€™s name, trade name or trade mark, and contact address must appear on the system, packaging or accompanying documentation.
* **Maintain a quality management system:** A QMS that complies with Article 17 must be implemented and kept up to date.
* **Record retention:** Providers have to retain the technical documentation (Article 11), quality management records (Article 17) and logs generated by the system when under their control (Article 19) for at least 10 years.
* **Conformity assessment and CE marking:** Prior to market placement, the relevant conformity assessment under Article 43 must be completed, the EU declaration of conformity (Article 47) prepared, and the CE mark (Article 48) affixed.
* **Registration:** Providers must register the high-risk AI system in the EU database as required by Article 49(1) before deployment.
* **Demonstrate conformity on demand:** Upon a reasoned request from a national competent authority, providers must show that the system complies with all Section 2 requirements and furnish supporting documentation (Article 16(k)).
* **Corrective actions:** If the system is non-compliant or risky, providers must take corrective measures (Article 20), inform other operators, and notify market surveillance authorities when Article 79(1) risks arise.
* **Accessibility requirements:** Providers have to ensure the system complies with accessibility rules established in Directives (EU) 2016/2102 and 2019/882.

## Traces to Other Standards

* **ISO/IEC 42001:** Article 16 aligns with the governance and lifecycle obligations in Clauses 5-10; the required QMS can be integrated with an AIMS that meets Annex A controls for documentation, risk treatment and incident response.
* **ISO/IEC 27001:** Record retention, conformity assessment evidence, and corrective actions map to Clauses 7-10 of an ISMS, especially documentation (7.5), operational control (8.1) and corrective action (10.2).
* **NIST AI RMF / NIST RMF:** Provider obligations mirror the GOVERN and MANAGE functions (risk accountability, incident response) and the RMF Prepare/Monitor steps (role assignment, continuous monitoring, reporting).
