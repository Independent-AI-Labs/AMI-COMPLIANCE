# ISO/IEC 27001: Support

## Description

Clause 7 covers the resources, competence, awareness, communication and documented information required to operate and improve the ISMS.

## Key Elements

### 7.1 Resources

Provide the resources needed to establish, implement, maintain and continually improve the ISMS (people, tools, infrastructure and budget).

### 7.2 Competence

* Determine the competence required for roles that affect information security performance.
* Ensure individuals are competent through education, training or experience, and retain appropriate records.

### 7.3 Awareness

Ensure personnel are aware of the information security policy, their role in maintaining the ISMS, and the consequences of nonconformity.

### 7.4 Communication

* Determine what needs to be communicated, when, by whom and through which channels.
* Cover both internal and external communications that are relevant to the ISMS (e.g. incident notifications, stakeholder updates).

### 7.5 Documented Information

* Maintain documented information required by ISO/IEC 27001 and determine additional documentation necessary for ISMS effectiveness.
* Control documented information by managing creation, review, approval, distribution, access, storage, protection, retention and disposition.
* Ensure documents remain legible, readily identifiable, and available to those who need them while preventing unauthorised use or alteration.

## Traces to Other Standards

* **EU AI Act:** Supports the quality management, documentation and training obligations in Articles 17, 18 and 26.
* **ISO/IEC 42001:** Shares identical support requirements, enabling harmonised training, communication and documentation for AI-specific processes.
* **NIST AI RMF / NIST RMF:** Reinforces GOVERN 1 and GOVERN 2 (policies, accountability, training) and aligns with RMF Prepare activities for role assignment and communication planning.
