# ISO/IEC 27001: Context of the Organization

## Description

Clause 4 of ISO/IEC 27001 requires organisations to understand internal and external issues, stakeholder expectations and the scope of their Information Security Management System (ISMS). These elements provide the foundation for risk-based planning and continual improvement.

## Key Elements

### 4.1 Understanding the Organization and Its Context

* Determine external and internal issues that affect the ability to achieve the ISMSâ€™s intended outcomes.
* **Assess whether climate change is a relevant issue** (2024 Amendment 1). Organisations must consider climate-related threats (e.g. extreme weather impacting facilities) alongside other contextual factors.

### 4.2 Understanding the Needs and Expectations of Interested Parties

* Identify interested parties relevant to the ISMS and their requirements.
* Note that **interested parties may have climate-related requirements** (Amendment 1 Note 2), influencing security controls, resilience planning and reporting.

### 4.3 Determining the Scope of the ISMS

* Define the ISMS boundaries and applicability considering context and interested parties.
* Document the scope so stakeholders understand which assets, processes and locations are covered.

### 4.4 Information Security Management System

* Establish, implement, maintain and continually improve the ISMS, including necessary processes and their interactions.

## Traces to Other Standards

* **EU AI Act:** Context analysis feeds the risk management required by Article 9 and supports alignment with AI-specific obligations (e.g. cybersecurity, QMS).
* **ISO/IEC 42001:** Clause 4 of ISO/IEC 42001 mirrors the ISMS context requirements, enabling integrated AIMS/ISMS scoping.
* **NIST AI RMF / NIST RMF:** Relates to the Map and Prepare steps, which establish mission context, stakeholders and risk tolerance.
