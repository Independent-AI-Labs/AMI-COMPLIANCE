# ISO/IEC 27001: Operation

## Description

Clause 8 specifies how organisations plan, implement and control processes to meet ISMS requirements, perform risk assessments and carry out risk treatment.

## Key Elements

### 8.1 Operational Planning and Control

* Plan, implement and control ISMS processes to meet information security requirements and the actions identified in Clause 6.
* Establish process criteria, implement controls in line with those criteria, and maintain documented information as evidence.
* **Control planned changes** and review unintended changes, taking action to mitigate adverse effects.
* **Manage externally provided processes, products and services** relevant to the ISMS to ensure they remain under appropriate control.

### 8.2 Information Security Risk Assessment

* Perform risk assessments at planned intervals and when significant changes occur, following the defined methodology and criteria from Clause 6.1.2.
* Retain documented information on assessment results for traceability and review.

### 8.3 Information Security Risk Treatment

* Implement the approved risk treatment plan.
* Retain documented information that demonstrates the effectiveness of implemented controls and tracks residual risk.

## Traces to Other Standards

* **EU AI Act:** Supports continuous risk management for high-risk AI systems (Article 9) and technical change-control obligations tied to conformity maintenance (Articles 43â€“44).
* **ISO/IEC 42001:** Clause 8 requirements are parallel, enabling joint operational controls for information security and AI governance.
* **NIST AI RMF / NIST RMF:** Aligns with the Manage function and with RMF Select, Implement and Assess steps for executing and validating controls.
