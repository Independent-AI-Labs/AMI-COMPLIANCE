# Feedback Request: SPEC-AUDIT

** The Audit Trail System specification (SPEC-AUDIT.md) is complete and comprehensive. The directory structure exists but implementation is pending. 

What would you like me to do next?

1. **Begin Phase 1 implementation** (Core Foundation: AuditRecord, AuditChain, AuditStore)?
2. **Review and validate the specification** against regulatory requirements?
3. **Create a detailed implementation checklist** for tracking progress?
4. **Something else**?

Please provide explicit instruction on how to proceed, as per the CLAUDE.md guidelines requiring user direction before implementation work.
